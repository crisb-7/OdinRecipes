                    <li>3 medium bananas (duh)</li>
                    <li>3 medium eggs</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup of all purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
                    <li>Butter or your preferred fat for frying</li>
                    <li>Cinnamon to taste</li>
                    <li>Vanilla extract imitation to taste</li>
                    <li>Maple syrup, optional</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Method</h2>
                This is the method of preparation of these pancakes.
                <ol>
                    <li>Add the bananas to a bowl and mash them well.</li>
                    <li>Then add the eggs and whisk them together with the mashed bananas.</li>
                    <li>Add in the flour and baking powder. Whisk until the mixture has a pancake batter consistency. Add more flour if necessary. 
                        If the batter is too thick, add a little bit of milk.</li>
                    <li>In a non-stick skillet, add in a tspn of butter and let it melt on low-medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Spoon in about 2 tablespoons worth of batter per each pancake. Drop in some blueberries and let it get golden brown before flipping</li>
                    <li>Repeat until all the batter is finished. Serve warm with maple syrup.</li>
                </ol>
