        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 slices of thick cut bacon, cut in half</li>
                <li>2 potatoes</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>3-4 eggs</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
            This is the method of preparation.
            <ol>
                <li>Add in your bacon to a cold and let the fat render out as it heats up.</li>
                <li>In the meantime, grate your potatoes and add a little salt. Squeeze out all the water from the potatoes.</li>
                <li>Pour some of the bacon fat aside but leave some in the pan (about 2-3 tablespoons).</li>
                <li>Add shredded potatoes to the pan and shape it however you like.</li>
                <li>Flip once golden brown and add more fat if necessary. Let the other side get golden brown. Remove from the pan.</li>
                <li>On another pan on medium-high heat, add 1-2 teaspoons of bacon fat and add the eggs to scramble.</li>
                <li>Finally, top your hash brown with some crumbled bacon, your scrambled eggs, and some sauerkraut if you have!</li>
            </ol>
