# Odin Recipes Project

Hello! This is the first project in the Odin Foundations curriculum in which I built a recipes website. This little project displays my skills in introductory HTML, since every line of HTML in this project was written by me from scratch. Keep in mind this is an introductory project, for it will be very simple. 

Additionally, it showcases my skills using Git and GitHub because I will (and have) use this version control system while building this website in order to keep track of my progress with VCS industry standards.
